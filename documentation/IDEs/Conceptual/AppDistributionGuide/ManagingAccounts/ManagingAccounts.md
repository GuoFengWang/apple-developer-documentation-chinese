# Managing Accounts  
# 账号管理

The Accounts preferences pane is the central location for managing all of the accounts your projects will use, including your Apple ID used to manage Apple Developer Program assets. By adding an Apple ID account, joining the Apple Developer Program, and assigning your project to a team, you provide Xcode with the credentials to manage your certificates, identifiers, and profiles. You’ll learn how to manage your Apple Developer Program accounts in this chapter.
